# MightyS1F
 Bleeding edge development repository for the **Mighty the Armadillo in Sonic 1 Forever** mod.
 
 Sprites by Shima, scripting by RAMDRAGONS, with ported game logic from the Sonic Mania Decompilation.

All new scripting is freely reusable AS LONG AS credit is given to associated parties (RAMDRAGONS, original Sonic Mania decompilation authors)

Currently implemented
- Close-to-accurate hammer drop, some issues in slope angle calculations, no landing dust, no after-images, and screen lock can't be easily replicated
- Half-working hacky crouch invulnerability reimplementation
- CheckShellHit function reimplementation that should be working?
